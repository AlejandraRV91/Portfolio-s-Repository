# Portfolio Proyect

On this project, I committed myself to fulfilling the rubric requirements described on GitHub's instructions, to get the maximum score to pass.

## Have a deployed front-end application.

We are able to find the application deployed on the following link below:

[Portfolio's URL](https://alejandrarv91.github.io/Portfolio-s-Repository.github.io/)

## Allow for user interaction through button clicks and form inputs.

Naturally, there are tags like inputs, selectors, buttons, etc developed to be used for the users to switch among the tabs and this way have a friendly interaction experience on the website.

## Make requests to an external API.
This project was developed using different API'S sources:

- [News](https://newsapi.org/)
: we used this API to get updated IT information.
- [Giphy](https://api.giphy.com/)
: we used this API to get the most popular giphies from social media.
- [Chuck norris jokes](https://api.chucknorris.io/)
: we used this API to get funny content like jokes about Chuck Norris movies.
- [random-stuff-api](https://rapidapi.com/pgamerxdev/api/random-stuff-api)
: we used this API to get funny and interesting content for the website.

- [uselessfacts](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/)
: we used this API to get useless but interesting scientific facts.
- [dogapi](https://dogapi.dog/)
: we used this API to get curious content and data about Dogs.
- [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/api)
: we used this API to get the MEME'S images used in our website, without text or caption on them.

## Add a button or icon to the error that displays when a form is incorrectly filled out. When this button or icon is clicked, the error is removed from the page.

we complied with this requirement when we created the "Self-discovery with us" section located in the <header>, this way, the user by not selecting a caption for MEME'S image, an error message will be displayed.

## Use [CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions) to add effects to your page.

We used these css transitions by incorporating keyframes within the project, as well as the use of the (.titleStyle) attribute for the website's title.

## Incorporate fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) onto your page to improve the styling.

we used multiple google fonts for this project, these are located in each CSS file.

## Store some information locally through [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage). This information should affect what is shown on the page when the page is reloaded.

we used this feature to save the person's amount who is getting the same result in the game, showing different types of messages like for example:

" You and other 2+ more have scored the same result"

## Use a CSS framework such as [Simple.css](https://simplecss.org/) or [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

In this case, we built from scratch all classes with their respective styles properties in each CSS file.

## Split your CSS or JavaScript into multiple files, with each file relating to a specific functionality. For example, create a new file called `api.js` that includes the JavaScript code that makes requests to your external API.

we classified our Javascript files for each <html> file, we did the same with the CSS ones.
